In this project, I will demonstrate How to create an S3 Bucket I'm doing this project to learn more about AWS 
<br />

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

<h2>walk-through:</h2>

In this step, I created an S3 Bucket and created space for files. I named the bucket and learnt that S3 bucket names are globally unique! This means once I create mine nobody else can have the same Bucket name.<br/>

Creating an S3 bucket took me a few minutes. The AWS console made it easy. I learnt about Access control list's (ACL). They are a set of rules that enable you to decide who has access to a resource. I chose to enable ACL's so that I could control who has access and what they can do with the resources.  <br/>
<br />
<br />
In this step, I made an HTML file that will set up my website. I also selected an image for my website and then uploaded both files into my S3 Bucket. This showed that the Bucket is working how it should.
